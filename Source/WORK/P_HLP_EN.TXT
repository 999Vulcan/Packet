cause the line to revert back to its original version. Note that
changes which can be undone are grouped into similar actions, such as
typing, or deleting characters. Any action type you perform that is
different than the last action type will cause the Undo information to

The list of processors allows to set, which actions will be carried
out by default at a choice of item of the {Integrator's:Packet} contents
depending on extension or mask of appropriate file name,
reaction on Ctrl+Enter, and also to define a set of actions, which
will be offered at a choice of item by keys Shift+Enter.

The global list is stored in a file "Packet.Ext" in the same
directory, in which Integrator is installed, and works for those
contentses, for which list with the help of a command
{"Local extension list edit":DLocalExt} is not created.

 Format of the list Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
To each extension or mask in the list of processors the separate
block, beginning with the symbol '>' and following for them
without a blank the mask of a file name is allocated.

Further in the same line through one or several blanks it is possible
to specify name of a program-processor or command MS DOS, being a processor
by default (on a key Enter) for files with a name, satisfying to a mask.
The name of a processable file is substituted in the end of a line
automatically at its choice, if the name of a processor does not contain
any of the following macros:

  !   - name of a processable file
  !.! - name with extension of a processable file
  !\  - directory of a processable file (without the finishing symbol "\")
  !!  - exclamation mark

If there is one of these macros, macro is carried out, and the file name
in the end of the line is not substituted.

If the processor by default is not specified, the file will be loaded
in the built-in text editor.

If you want, that on a key Ctrl+Enter instead of a load in the
external text editor there was the call of any other program,
the line, beginning with a symbol '#', should follow. After this
symbol (it is possible without a blank) it is necessary to specify
name of a program-processor or DOS command.

Further up to the following line, beginning with '>', there is the
list of processors, which will be offered for files with a name,
satisfying to a mask.

To each processor there should correspond one line in the list,
and the part of this line up to a symbol '^' will be be purely name
of a processor, and other is the name, which will be shown
in the list at pressing Shift+Enter.

If there is not enough symbol '^' in a line, this line will be
considered as name, and purely as name of a processor.

At desire you can allocate under one letter in the names with symbols
'~' from two parties. Then at a choice from the list you can use hot
keys.

The line, containing only a symbol "-", inserts into the list a
divider.

Empty lines and lines, beginning with ";", are ignored.

The same list can be in the beginning of the description of
processors. It is the common list. It will be added in a
beginning of the list, given out on Shift+Enter, for each type of
files.

Reverse Mouse Buttons makes the right mouse button take on the
normal functions of the left--and vice versa.

You also can to choose one from two possible modes of operations of
the mouse - the smooth mouse, wich emulate the graphic cursor of
the mouse in a text mode, or usual textual mouse.

The mode of the smooth Mouse works only at presence of the
videoadapter as EGA, VGA or SVGA. On all other videoadapters the
usual textual mouse, irrespective of an established here mode will
join.

If in a mode of the smooth mouse you will find out any unpleasant
effects owing to the conflict to your videoadapter or driver of the
mouse, switch in a mode of the usual mouse or change the driver on
standard. However the probability of occurrence of such conflict is
close to zero, therefore it is by no means not necessary to
disconnect this remarkable mode from precaution.

The smooth mouse can also be disconnected, by starting the Integrator
with parameter '/NM'.

Have to the point in a kind, that by work in some modes of the
adapter SVGA use of the smooth mouse is the sole
possible variant, as the majority of mouse drivers
incorrectly behave in such modes and exclude use of the standard
textual Mouse.

screen modes - 25 or 43/50 lines, and also to establish
a videomode of the high resolution for SVGA-adapters.

The mode 43/50 lines is inaccessible on some old models of
videoadapters (CGA and other), and the SVGA modes are specific for
various videocards.

You can use the utility ChkModes, delivered in a complete set of the
{Integrator:Packet}, for determination of numbers and
characteristics of textual videomodes, supported by your
videoadapter.

If your videoadapter supports SuperVGA-modes, you can use them,
working in the Integrator. For this purpose enter in the input line
"SVGA mode 1" and/or "SVGA mode 2" hexadecimal number of
one/two videomodes and choose the appropriate videomode in group of
dependent buttons "Screen mode".

If at transition in SVGA-modes, revealed by the program ChkModes,
there will be any problems, address to the documentation on your
videoadapter for the more detailed information.

The integrator does not supervise a correctness of a choice of
SVGA-mode number.

 Dialog windows Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
By one of versions of windows in the {Integrator "Packet":Packet}
so-called dialog windows act. They are intended for management
of work of various commands of the Integrator. For all lines of the
menu, where after the name of a command is specified a designation
"...", presence of the window of dialogue is meant.

The dialog window is always in an active condition on the screen,
and it differs it from usual windows. It is quite clear, that for
continuation of work it should be closed.
It causes use of a key Esc as of an additional opportunity for closing
such windows.

Inside a window of dialogue is stipulated five basic types of
elements of management:

At active group the label is marked by the appropriate colour. The
transition from one group to other can be carried out with the help
of the mouse, or pressing the key Tab (forward) or Shift+Tab (backward),
or by pressing the key with the marked letter of the label.

.topic Buttons
 Action buttons Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Pressing on any such button results in fulfilment of
certain actions.

So, the "OK" button is reserved for the installation of brought in changes
and transition to fulfilment of a command.

The {"Cancel":CancelBtn} button is intended for end of work of
the dialog window with an ignoring of all changes.

Pressing the "Help" button opens the help window for a current
dialog window.

The listed buttons carry out these standard actions for all dialog windows
of the {Integrator:Packet}.

Some dialog windows have also buttons specific only for them.

For pressing the button it is necessary to click on this button
the mouse, or to press on the keyboard the key with the marked letter
of the button (it is possible in a combination to the key Alt), or to
make the button active with the help of keys Tab (forward) or Shift+Tab
(backward) and to press Enter.

If any of buttons in the given moment is not active, the pressing of
a key Enter will entail pressing the so-called "default button",
which is marked by the special colour.

.topic CheckBoxes
 Check boxes Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßß
Any dialog window can contain the greater or smaller
quantity of check boxes as far as it is necessary for
fulfilment of the command.

The independent buttons are always used for the assignment of conditions
with a strictly limited choice of initial meanings: actively or inactively.

Designation '[X]' specifies on the fact, that the given condition is in
an active condition.

When the group of independent buttons on the screen is active, the
moving on lines can be carried out with the help of arrow keys or
mouse.

If you wish to change a condition of the particular button,
you should press the Space or marked letter in the line of the condition
name.

assignment of conditions with a plenty of possible meanings.

Each group answers for installation only one conditions, the name of
which is carried out in the group heading.

The current meaning in group is designated on the screen '()'.

If you wish to establish new value, you should make
the group active and to make in it the choice with the help of the
mouse, arrow keys or marked letters.

.topic InputLines
 Input lines Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßß
In many dialog windows you could be necessary to enter the text for
the assignment of the specific condition of fulfilment of the command.
With this purpose input lines are used. To make active the input line is
possible by a usual way, thus in a field there will be the cursor.

You can use any symbolical keys, Home, End, Backspace, Del, Ins and
some other for input of a necessary line.

If further to press Enter, it will result in closing a window
of dialogue and subsequent fulfilment of a command. Therefore if it
is necessary to you to set in a dialog window any another information,
it is necessary to finish input of a line by pressing of the key Tab.

If to the right of a field of input the special button of a history
is displayed 'ÞÝ', it specifies an opportunity of the
manipulation to the list of the previous values for the given
field. In this list all lines are remembered which ever were entered in a
field of input and which can use at any moment. Due to this convenient
opportunity easily to get rid of unnecessary practice of recurrence of input
from the keyboard of earlier entered lines.

To open a window with the list of the previous values,
it is enough, being in the input line, to press the key Dn
or to click any key of the mouse on the button 'ÞÝ'.

With the help of keys of moving of the cursor or double click of the
mouse it is possible to easily choose any value from
the list, then the window will be closed, and the chosen line will be
displayed in a field of input.

 Attention !!!

A window is a bordered screen area that you can move, resize, zoom,
rearrange, close, and open.

Integrator makes it easy to spot the active window; it always has a
double-lined border around it, and it always has these elements:

You can have any number of windows open in Borland Pascal (memory allowing),
but only one window can be active at any time. The active window is the one
that you're currently working in.

Generally, any command you choose or text you type applies only to the
active window.

If your windows overlap, the active window is always the topmost one (the
one on top of all the others).

The first nine windows you open in Integrator display a window number in
the title bar.

Alt-0 brings up the Window List dialog box, which lists all opened
windows.

To make a window active (topmost), press Alt and the window number.

Edit windows also show the cursor's position (the current line and column
number) as YY:XX in the bottom of the Edit window frame, where YY is the
line number and XX is the column number.

 How to use hot keys Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
You can use a hot key (if it is established) for fast access to
the appropriate item, irrespective of, whether subcontents, in
which this item is situated, is current, and the contents is active.

For this purpose it is necessary to you to press keys Ctrl and Alt in
a combination with the hot key established by you. The current register
of the keyboard thus has not importance.

Thus the search of item occurs in all open tables of contents, since
top on the screen.

If you want to transfer to the program, started on a hot key,
parameters, use a combination of keys Shift and Alt with an
established hot key. For a textual file this combination of keys will
start the external text editor.

In case the contents window, in which there is the
required item, is active, you can press a hot key, not
pressing keys Ctrl and Alt. As well as earlier, to be switched on the
latin register it is not certain. Thus the search will occur only in
an active table of contents, and the hot keys of tables of contents,
being in inactive windows, are ignored.

Care of parameters to the started program or editing of a textual
file in the external text editor press a hot key in a combination to
a key Shift.

If you want nevertheless to search for item on a hot key in all
tables of contents, use a combination of a hot key to keys Ctrl and
Alt (or Shift and Alt - see above).

The list of accessible hot keys you can receive by the command
{"Contents³Hot keys³List":DHotKeysList}.

.topic HotKeysList

þ To choose necessary item by cursor arrows and to press Enter for
usual processing and Shift+Enter for start of the program with an
inquiry of parameters or editing of a file by the external text
editor.

þ To double click the mouse on necessary item for usual
processing or all the same, but at a pressed key Shift - for start of the
program with an inquiry of parameters or editing of a file by the external
text editor.

þ To press the hot key appropriate to item for usual processing or,
but in a combination with a key Shift - for start of the program with
an inquiry of parameters or editing of a file by the external text
editor.

It is possible to effectively use hot keys without using the
list - see {use of hot keys:How2UseHotKeys}.

 The recommendations for construction of the documents Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
At construction of the documents it is possible to mark in the text a
beginning and end of a drawing, to prevent its break on pages.
Insert into the text a line ".db" and ".de" for the
indication of a beginning and the end of a drawing accordingly.

The Integrator supports automatic numbering of drawings and reference
to them and to items of the document.

Drawing or the item of the document, on which in the document it is
necessary to refer, should have the unique identifier. The
identifiers of drawings are set by the second word after a key word
".db", the identifiers of items of the document are set in the first
line of the annotation to this item by the second word after a key word
".name". The identifier can contain any symbols, except a blank. The
large and small latin letters do not differ.

The reference to a drawing or item is made out in the document as
follows:

           [  ]:Identifier

Here Identifier - identifier of item or drawing. At construction of
the document it together with a previous colon and following for
it blank will be removed from the text, and the space between
opening and closing square brackets will be allocated under
number of a drawing or item of the document (the square brackets can
too be engaged by number and in the document do not join).

       Example 1:

     For this purpose it is necessary simply to use opportunities on
  copying blocks of the text through Clipboard (See []: IntEd ).

                     < End of an example 1>

       Example 2:

   .db Examp

        < Drawing or table >

       Fig. [ ]:Examp - window of installation of colours
   .de
                     < End of an example 2>

Lines, beginning with ";", will not be transformed, but initial ";"
is rejected.

Each drawing automatically receives the serial number.

To not give number to any fragment of the text, made
between the lines ".db" and ".de", specify as the identifier of a
drawing "-" (minus).

For a fast and convenient insert of the reference on item in a
textual file in a window of the built-in editor, press Ctrl+F8 or
choose the command {"Editor³Insert reference":InsRef}.

At construction of the document it is recommended to include the
"Show protocol" mode for duly detection of the unresolved references.
